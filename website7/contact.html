					<h2>Mental Health Foundation</h2>
					<p>The Mental Health Foundation has a vision of a world with good mental health for all.
					The Foundations mission is to help people understand, protect and sustain their mental health.
					Good mental health is fundamental to thriving in life. It is the essence of who we are and how we experience the world. 
					Yet, compared to physical health, so little is commonly known about mental ill health and how to prevent it. That must change.</p>
					<p>The Mental Health Foundation is the UK’s charity for everyone’s mental health. 
					With prevention at the heart of what the Foundation does, they aim to find and address the sources of mental health problems.
					"Prevention is at the heart of what we do, because the best way to deal with a crisis is to prevent it from happening in the first place."</p>
