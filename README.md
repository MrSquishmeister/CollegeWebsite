# Mental Health Website
###

You have been tasked with raising awareness of mental health amongst students and the impact it has on their daily lives at the college.

It has been agreed that a website would be a good way to communicate such information, as such, you have been commissioned to design, implement, test and deploy the website. The website will promote awareness of Mental health, specifically targeting resilience. 

The website must include information on mental health, what it is and how it affects young people. You have been authorised to use resources from https://www.cwmt.org.uk/ to help formulate this website. A Presentation has been provided below for guidance on the information that would be expected to appear in your website

The client has requested that the colour scheme of the site can be determined by yourself, however, must be contemporary, accessible and must contain a minimum of 4 interlinked pages (including the home page).

You have been asked to provide official links that users can go to for further help and support, they would prefer these links open in either a new window or a new tab.

Content on the site must be thoroughly spell and grammar checked to ensure potential users of the site are not distracted with poor quality content and the site should be as efficient as possible as the client has been warned about high “bandwidth” costs due the potential for large volumes of users.

The client is keen to trial a reporting system that would send information to a school safeguarding team. This reporting system will allow the user to submit a form detailing the nature of the report (from a pre-defined user created list), a written description, the name of the person reporting, along with the name of the person being reported, and a severity rating (from 1: not severe to 5 very severe). This system SHOULD NOT send an email and is purely a test for aesthetics and feasibility.

The client has stated they will be available for two 10-minute interviews due to their busy schedule. Your first interview will be to show your completed documentation and designs to the client for them to sign off before implementation and testing. The second interview will be with the client to critique the website and make amendments as necessary. 

Content that could feature (not limiting):
•	Central place for support and guidance
•	Information on mental health (see PowerPoint below)
•	Case studies
•	Videos/Quizzes
•	Official helplines
